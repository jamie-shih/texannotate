# LaTeX Rainbow

This service compiles LaTeX codes into PDFs and extract detailed layout and reading information. 
Designed specifically for the academic publications.
This tool not only compiles LaTeX but also annotates each token and figures, 
retrieves their positions in the PDF, identifies corresponding semantic structure labels, and mark the correct reading order. 

## Update
[2024-06-13]:
1. Refactored implementation of multiprocessing.
2. Refactored the calls to LaTeXML.
3. Guessing the labeling and reading order of unsuccessfully colored words based on line numbers.
4. Aligned `PyMuPDF` and `pdfplumber` based on position. Now we recognize font flags such as *bold*, _italic_.

[2024-07-01]:
1. Added fallback XeLaTeX compilation with additional CJK fonts, enabling documents with English, Chinese and Japanese text to compile successfully.

[2024-03-26]: 
1. Added [de-macro](https://ctan.org/pkg/de-macro?lang=en) preprocessing, which cleans up LaTeX code by expanding a portion of a simple custom macros defined by `\newcommand`, and also inserts `\input` into the main file. This method should increase the success rate of parsing.
2. Improved conservative parsing strategy for `LatexGroupNode`. We previously didn't color-code them because we were concerned that it was breaking the parameters of the unknown macro. Now we include `LatexGroupNode` with a length of more than 20 characters in the color annotation.
3. Added a black font to the PDF output. This is because color markup still changes the layout of the original paper to a greater or lesser extent. To keep the annotation looking the same as the original document, we will now compile the "original document" in black font.

[2024-04-08]:
1. LaTeXML is installed in the AutoTeX container and is used to standardize the code for `tex` column in the annotation.
2. Applied standardized annotation to `equation` and `table` annotation.
3. Refined annotation strategy for `algorithm` environments.


## Main Purpose:

1. **LaTeX Compilation**: Compile LaTeX into PDF using a dockerized environment, leveraging TexLive2023.
2. **LaTeX Annotation**: Add color labels to each token and figure in LaTeX code to facilitate automatic extraction of document layout.
3. **Data Extraction**: Extract fine information about every token and figure, such as its type, position, and corresponding section in the compiled PDF document, and output this as a pandas DataFrame.

## Prerequisites:

- Docker
- Python3.8+

## Usage:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InsightsNet/texannotate.git
cd texannotate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For example, you wish to annotate the LaTeX project for arXiv paper 
[1601.00978](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00978). First, fetch the sources for the project:

```bash
mkdir downloaded
wget -O downloaded/1601.00978.tar.gz https://arxiv.org/e-print/1601.00978 --user-agent "Name <email>"
python main.py
```

## Output Format

The tool outputs two pandas DataFrame for each input LaTeX source package, which has a total of 13 columns.

### Table of Contents
| section_id | nested_to |
|---------------|-------|
| int           | int   |

The first row is the Table of Contents root node,  whose *section_id* is the 0 and *nested_to* is -1;


### Figures and Tokens
| reading_order | label | block_id | section_id | text | page_no | x0    | y0    | x1    | y1    | font | font_size  | flags | tex | page_size | line_no |
|---------------|-------|------|---------|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| int           | str   | int  | int     | str   | int  | float | float | float | float | str  | float | list  | str | list | int|

Each row is an figure or token being extracted from the PDF, the integer *reading_order* starting from 0 is the author's writing order. 
If it is -1, the token is not content written by the author (e.g., watermarks and headers).
*label* are semantic structure labels, which includes: Abstract, Author, Caption, Equation, Figure, Footer, List, Paragraph, Reference, Section, Table, Title.

See [example](doc/example.ipynb) about the annotation of one paper.

Here's another [example](doc/tree_summarize.ipynb) summarizing the details of the paper with an LLM.

## Acknowledgments

- The compilation service is a dockerized wrapper around the [AutoTeX](https://metacpan.org/pod/TeX::AutoTeX) library used by arXiv to automatically compile submissions to arXiv. We [modified](https://github.com/) part of it.
- The code for the compilation service is essentially inherited from [texcompile](https://github.com/andrewhead/texcompile.git), and this repository was formerly a fork of it.
- [pylatexenc](https://github.com/phfaist/pylatexenc.git) 3.0alpha is used to identify and traverse the latex code.
- [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber.git) is used to extract shapes and texts from PDF files.
- [de-macro](https://ctan.org/pkg/de-macro?lang=en) parses and expands simple macro definitions.

# TODO:
- [x] A prettier frontend (like streamlit) to interact with papers and(or) to bundle with LLMs.
- [x] Parse `.cls` and `.sty` file.
  - [ ] Cannot parse some environment, we need update `pylatexenc`.
- [ ] Make our own LaTeX package inheriting from [xcolor](https://github.com/latex3/xcolor) in CTAN to avoid conflict.
  - [ ] Investigate Underlying logic of the coloring order.
  - [ ] Explore the method of SyncTex.
  - [x] Line based label correction.
- [x] Rainbow colors [#1](https://github.com/InsightsNet/texannotate/pull/1)
